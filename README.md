# CS-305-Cybersecurity
Module 8 assignment
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons.  They were seeking to add a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications.


What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? 
I believe I listened (read) the expectations of Artemis Financial and researched the best methods to provide a financial consulting company secure communication by layering methods like using a secure Algorithm Cipher, certificate generation and verifying the cipher with the checksum.


What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Secure code is a matter of trust.  Without trust customers will not use services from a company.  When the cyber attack occurs and the patrons of the financial institute and Artemis Financial learn that security was not a high priority, they will no longer trust the company working for them.  If there is a lack of trust the customers will find someone else to trust.  This will close the business.  If secure code is not addressed in the software development life cycle and the financial company loses customers, the engineering company that specializes in software design and development (Global Rain) will also lose customers.


What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The vulnerability assessment was logical and easy to follow.  Because this was a graded assignment I didn’t try to update the versions of components that said a newer version had resolved that issue.   I know I would have tried that.  I also did not experience learning how this would influence a “professional” team’s decisions, but I did learn how to find vulnerabilities, read about them (how to manage them) and suppress them.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

It is reasonable to manage security as you build an application.  The reality that many different agents are sneaking around to find ways to break into your work to use for their own purpose makes me want to find a variety of methods to protect it.  I picture two large teams of kids playing Red Rover.  The runner is looking for the weakest link to help his team win.   If he gets through he can steal a player from that team.  Secure code makes it harder to find the weak link.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
In the future I will use the techniques taught and research others.  Reading articles on https://cybersecuritydive.com has opened my eyes to how fast things change. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

Every step and misstep in the assignment was surrounded by googling vocabulary to clarify my understanding, reading articles related to the step, and looking over assigned reading including Oracle docs.  I found a few video explanations which I watched also.  All this builds my understanding of the topic and links it to other related topics creating a stronger foundation in my repertoire of cybersecurity.  
Honestly, I am always looking for ways to improve.  I know I am advanced above what I have previously posted but I am not ready to say look at this work.  I am still improving.
